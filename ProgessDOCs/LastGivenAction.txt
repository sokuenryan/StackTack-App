    - working on making the bills print out the bottom using similar code that I had
    used in the react-router-budget-app VScode file.

    - Working on a way to get the bill-content class to expapnd with 
    the number of added bills. 
    - Considered making it so that after a certain number of bills were submitted,
    it would switch pages. Wanted the data to also be printed to the Calendar on the
    next tab. 
    - Still haven't yet decided if I am going to follow the UXUI wireframe in that 
    regard yet.

    - I am adding an dropdown menu for weeks 1 - 4 in replacement of dropdown 
    'categories' 

Last given action on 6/27/2024
    - Currrently restructuring the Recent Bills Menu to look a bit more neat when 
    there is mass amount of data printed. 
    - Need to get a client side server up so that the data can save itself and not be 
    deleted when refreshed. 

    - Hopefully soon I will be able to duplicate everything into the next 2 buttons: 
    Investments and Credit. But before that I need to be able to have the table 
    update itself and to be able to have the table do that, I need to have a Client 
    side server be able to run CRUD.

    - Had trouble getting the percentage to update on the other component, so I just 
    included it in the same one. 
    - Figured it would also be more time effiecient 
    anyways and I figured the design was already a bit different anyways with the
    "week" dropdown menu.

    - I had just restructued the Create New Bills page, changed up the dimensions and 
    the colors a bit. It's now working beautifly. 
    - I have just made it so that the fractions can be calculated successfuly out of 
    total bills. 
    - My next action I need to do is get it to print out a whole number under 
    'Bill Left'. 

Last given action 7/2/2024
    - I completed the Create New Bills tab area of the Bills Section. 
    - Currently working on the Calendar Tab.
    - successfully added the react-calendar to the application and styled it. 
    The next thing I need to work on is getting whatever bills are printed out in the 
    "Bill List" section to show up on the next tab in the designated dates given. 
    - Hopefully after I can duplicate most of this code into the Investments and Credit 
    area and then the whole project is completed!

    - I had a slight issue last night with git push due to changing the repo name.
    - It was saying something about not having some things saved locally and this
    being due to the fact that there were more than one repo being pushed by the same 
    ref. 
    - I had to do a git pull before doing a git push and then it worked. 
 
Last given action 7/4/2024
    - A bit of screwing around with things. I need to do more styling since I edited
     it a lot mostly with the bill list area. 
    - Calendar does print out to it, but does not update when deleting or editing. 
    - SAVE THIS TO YOUR REPO ASAP!

    - Spent most the shift getting the react-calendar to work. 
    - BUG 1: wasn't printing to the calendar 

    - BUG 2: When it did print to the calendar, it didn't change when I edited 
    or deleted the data. 
    - Tried to edit the handleEdit and the handleDelete added several different
    lines of code
    - Went through several copy and pastings from github to reset, 
    - Turned to AI for help with debugging
    - Ended up deleting several conversation when it got to messy and the AI I believe
    was causing more issues.

Last given action of 07/08/2024
    - Started on the new tab called "investment" but there were a lot of naming 
    issues with the classnames. 
    - Duplicated most of the code from the Bills.jsx over to the investment 
    portion of the application, but it still needs some major fix ups. 
    Removed 3 major components: The week dropdown-menu, the date input, and the 
    child compoent Calendar mainly associated with the parent component of Bills.jsx. 

Last given action 07/10/2024
    - Calendar got screwed up on styling  at some point. 
    - The several duplication attempts to take the code from the bills section
    to the investments section seemed to create more issues.  
    - The calendar styles were not being registered and the reason 
    - The reason was I had imported the react-calendar/dist/Calendar.css file
    from node_modules and it was overriding my styles. 
    - But it was working fine before.

Last given action of 07/11/2024
 - created the Credit page. 
 - created the Investments page. 

Last Given action of 07/16/2024
    - I have successfully started implementing the plans into place
    - I added a new tab page to both Investment and Credit called Existing
    Investments or Existing Credit. 
    - Existing Investments can so far print the name and the amount from 
    the Create NewInvestment Data onto it. 
    - I also inplmented a working contribute and edit button. 
    - Contribute button can add numbers but cannot save the data. 
    - Edit button can edit the number contributed successfully and has 
    an 'update' button. 
    - Edit button needs CSS styling
    - The Existing Credit needs the same features as the Existing Investments
    so Once I finish with that I will copy and paste the similar features to 
    Existing Credit and alt what is needed.
    - Added a banner so you can't add any contribution number that exeeds
    that of the current Investment

    --Update-- 
    - Finished the Existing Investments page. 
    - Able to pull data from investmentsList so that whatever data get created
    it can print out onto the next tab page.
    - has a working contribution button that can add any number and print it 
    out with a default of 0.00
    - All the data created by the contribution button can also be saved to the
    local storage. Just like the investmentList. 
    - Has the ability to recognize when the contribution amount matches the 
    investmentList amount and bring up a pop up message that congratulates the
    user on reaching their investent marker.
    - Has and edit button that can update the amount if by accident you put in
    the wrong contribution amount. 
    - updated the AddNewInvestment page so that when you hit delete it also
    deletes the data that was also made in contributions. 
    - This way when you create a new investment and then click on the the 
    "existing investments" tab it won't auto show the old data of the last 
    contribution amount since before it wasn't attached to that component that
    created the list in the first place.

 a specified debt number.

 toggle button to signify if it's paid or not. 
 - Ability to edit the name and the amount
 - Ability to delete the listed items

 the local storage created by the Create New Credit Line tab. 
 - Has the ability to name the name and amount 
 - Has a contribution button with the ability to save the contribution amount 
 to the local storage.

--additonal fixes--
    - Made it so that when you delete the data from the listed items created
    in the Create New Credit Line tab it also deletes all corrisponding 
    contribution data created in the Existing Credit Lines tab. 

    - Corrected the credit page so that it was able to clear the input logs
    after submitting the Credit line entry.

    - Had an issue with the AddNewBill where the week wasn't updating 
    when using the edit button. 
    - Bug was fixed so now it can. There was no issue when creating the bill.
    
    - Fixed the banner message in the Credit page, due to the fact it said 
    "Your current contribution exceeds your current investment amount"
    - Altered the toastify message to include an celebration emoji
    - Altered the text on the "table" feature on the Credit page so now it says 
    "Completed", "Active", and "Progress" instead of 
    "Amount Paid" "Amount Left", and "Progress"
